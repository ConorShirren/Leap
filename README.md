## :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements

First of all you will need to make sure that you have Python 3, pip and npm installed, as it is
required by `Django` while using this application to integrate with the Strava APIs.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can proceed with the installation of the installation of required node modules for our Angular client

```bash
cd client
npm update
npm install
```

If you have any problems regarding this installation, please see 
[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) & [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) Documentation.
